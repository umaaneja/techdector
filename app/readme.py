What you’ll need (big picture)

Crawling & fetching — fast, polite site fetchers (support HTTP/2, TLS), queueing and worker pool.

Static analysis (fast) — parse HTML, headers, cookies and script srcs with regex/fingerprint rules.

Dynamic analysis (slow-but-accurate) — headless browser (Puppeteer / Playwright) to execute JS and inspect window, loaded modules, and runtime artifacts.

Fingerprint database — structured set of detection rules (regexes, header matches, script matches, cookie names, DOM selectors, JS global variables). Keep them versioned.

Enrichment — DNS, WHOIS, TLS cert metadata, IP / ASN, GeoIP, CDN/WAF detection, Google Tag Manager / analytics parsing.

Storage & indexing — per-site JSON + search index (Elasticsearch / OpenSearch) + OLAP for analytics (BigQuery / ClickHouse).

API & UI — lookup API, bulk lookups, browser extension/snippet, dashboard with tech filters and lead lists.

Monitoring & CI for fingerprints — automated tests (detect true/false positives on a curated site corpus) and pipelines to ingest new fingerprints.

Detection techniques (concrete)

HTTP headers & server banners — Server, X-Powered-By, Set-Cookie names. (good first-pass).

Static HTML rules — meta tags, <script src=...>, link hrefs, rel="manifest", presence of wp- paths etc. (fast).

JS globals & objects — after executing JS, inspect window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__, __NEXT_DATA__, ga, gtag, __webpack_require__ etc. (requires headless).

Script filename / package fingerprints — script URLs often reveal library names and versions (e.g., /wp-includes/js/jquery/).

Cookie names — certain platforms use predictable cookies.

TLS / Cert & DNS — issuer names, SANs, and DNS CNAMEs reveal CDNs/hosting providers.

Behavioral probes — attempt specific endpoints (e.g., /server-status, /admin patterns) only if allowed — careful with legality.

Heuristics + ML — combine signals into probabilistic classifier to lower false positives for ambiguous evidence.
Many open-source projects use this fingerprint approach — Wappalyzer being a leading one.
